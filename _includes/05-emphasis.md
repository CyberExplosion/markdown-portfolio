I'm an *Internation Student*, howeve, I begun studying English when I was in **3rd grade** and because of that it gives me an edge over most of the students that went to school with me. I'm currently a college student who has taken an interest in majoring in **Computer Science** and thus want to *improve* my skill by practicing and familiarizing with the *tech scene*. Thank you for listening :heart:
